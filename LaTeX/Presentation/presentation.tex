\section{What are quantum dots?}

\begin{frame}{Quantum dots as artificial atoms}

	\uncover<+->{Quantum dots can be thought as \alert{artificial atoms}.}

	\uncover<+->{Similarities with natural atoms:}
	
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item They are made up of electrons confined in an \emph{attractive potential}
		\item They have a shell-structure with its relative \alert{magic numbers}
	\end{itemize}

	\uncover<+->{Differences:}
	
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item \emph{Shape} of the potential (2D isotropic harmonic potential)
		\item \emph{Dimensions} (quantum dots are a few hundred angstroms big)
		\item \emph{Structure} and source of the potential
	\end{itemize}
	
	\note{
		The term ``quantum dots'' refers to finite fermion systems consisting of an artificial 3D confinement of a few electrons, that have a size of only a few hundred angstroms.
		
		Although the definition of quantum dots given above is quite precise, I prefer a more immediate one: ``quantum dots are \emph{artificial atoms}''. Despite its simplicity, this definition contains a good amount of relevant information. Like natural atoms, in fact, quantum dots are made up of electrons confined in an attractive potential; and as one may guess, they show a similar shell-like structure with its relative \emph{magic numbers}.
		
		Such confinement is usually achieved by restricting the two-dimensional electron gas that forms at the interface between two different semiconductor materials (or heterostructure), either laterally or vertically.
		
		However, there are some obvious differences \alert{READ DIFFERENCES}.
		
		While in natural atoms the attractive potential is generated by a charged nucleus, in quantum dots there is no such a thing.
		
		To understand how the confinement is generated in this case, we have to take a look at the internal structure of such devices.

	\note{
		Quantum dots are built by stacking up different layers of semiconductors. The electron gas forms at the interface of different layers, and the confinement is obtained by applying a voltage to the top metal electrodes -- called \emph{gates}. In the Figure, the white bars have a length of $\SI{0.5}{\micro\meter}$.; so, the gates are created by lithographic patterning.

		Another common method to fabricate quantum dots is to build heterostructure pillars by etching techniques. Here, the electrodes are at the top and at the bottom of the pillars.

		Other fabricating processes include self-growth mechanisms, in which the growth conditions determine the form of the structure (that can be pyramidal, disk shaped or lens shaped), and cleaved-edge overgrowth, that consists in two separate Molecular Beam Epitaxy growths on a specific substrate.

\begin{frame}{The Coulomb blockade effect}

	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item The electron island is weakly coupled with source and drain via tunnel barriers.

		The behavior of a quantum dot can be analyzed by studying its electron transport mechanism. In order to do that, the dot is connected to a circuit that provides a certain gate voltage, and its conductance is measured.

		Let's see what happens in terms of the electrochemical potential.
		
		Let's consider the low-temperature, low-bias voltage case ($eV_{\text{bias}},k_BT \ll e^2/C_{\Sigma}$). Let's also suppose that, initially, the electrochemical potential inside the dot -- $\mu_N$ -- is lower than the electrochemical potential of the drain -- $\mu_D$: the transport is blocked due to the Coulomb blockade effect.
		
		The number of electrons inside the dot is $N$.

	\note{
		Now, we can decrease the gate voltage: the overall effect is that we have a linear increase in $\mu_N$ wrt the gate voltage. Eventually, $\mu_N$ will align to $\mu_D$ ($\mu_N = \mu_D$), which means that an electron can leave the dot. At the same time, if $\mu_S \gtrsim \mu_D$, an electron from $\mu_S$ can enter the dot; the overall effect is that the number of the electrons inside the dot oscillates between $N$ and $N-1$, and an electric current flows through the dot from the drain to the source. In terms of the conductance, this corresponds in a peak.

		If we keep lowering the gate voltage -- i.e., increasing $\mu_N$ -- until $\mu_N > \mu_S$, then the dot is left with only $N-1$ electrons. Now, the level to consider is $\mu_{N-1}$: you see that it's far below $\mu_D$, so the current is blocked again.

\section{The algorithm}

\begin{frame}{The variational principle}
	
	\uncover<+->{The \alert{variational principle} is a powerful tool that allows, for \emph{any} system, to calculate an \emph{upper bound} estimate for the \emph{ground state} energy.}
	
	\uncover<+->{Being $E_{\text{gs}}$ the ground-state energy, $\Ket{\psi}$ a state whatsoever and $\hat{H}$ the Hamiltonian of the system, the principle states that}
	
	\uncover<+->{
		\begin{equation}
			E_{\text{gs}} \leq \frac{\Braket{\psi|\hat{H}|\psi}}{\Braket{\psi|\psi}}.
		\end{equation}
	}
	
	\uncover<+->{We are going to use this principle by calculating the quantity on the right hand side, for a chosen \emph{trial wave-function} $\psi_T$. We will come back later on how to guess a realistic $\psi_T$.}
	
	\note{
		The Variational Principle is a method of general validity that can be used to gather information about a system with a Hamiltonian that we are unable to diagonalize. Specifically, this principle gives us an \emph{upper bound} for the energy of the ground state. The formulation is really simple: if you pick \emph{any state $\Ket{\psi}$ whatsoever}, then \alert{SHOW FORMULA ON SLIDE}.
		
		In practice, one chooses a class of states for $\Ket{\psi}$ parametrized by one or more parameters -- the so-called \emph{variational parameters}, and then calculates the quantity $E_T$ for multiple sets of values of the variational parameters $\alpha_1\ldots,\alpha_n$. The lower value of $E_T$ obtained in this way is the required upper bound. If one manages to find an even lower value for $E_T$ with a more clever wave-function, then he has found a better upper bound for the ground state energy.

		The only trouble with this method is that we never know for sure how close we are to the \emph{actual} ground state energy; all we get for sure is just an upper bound. However, if one manages to guess a \emph{realistic} $\Ket{\psi}$, he often gets values for the ground state energy that miraculously match the actual ones.
	}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The local energy}
	
	\uncover<+->{In the function-representation of the states, we can recast the above relation as}
	
	\uncover<+->{
		\begin{equation}
			E_{\text{gs}}
			\leq \int d\vec{\tau}\,\mathcal{P}(\vec{\tau})E_L(\vec{\tau})
			\simeq \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}E_L(\vec{\tau}),
		\end{equation}
	}
	
	\uncover<+->{where}
	
	\uncover<+->{
		\begin{equation}
			\mathcal{P}(\vec{\tau}) = \frac{|\psi_T|^2}{\int d\vec{\tau} \, |\psi_T|^2}
			\qquad
			\text{and}
			\qquad
			E_L(\vec{\tau}) = \frac{1}{\psi_T} \hat{H} \psi_T.
		\end{equation}
	}
	
	\uncover<+->{The quantity $E_L$ is called the \alert{local energy}.}
	
	\note{
		Calculating $E_T$ as it appears in the previous relation is not a piece of cake. However, we can recast that equation in a simpler form as \alert{READ THE SLIDE}.
	}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The local energy}
	
	\uncover<+->{Let's do a brief recap.}
	
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Our upper bound is given by $\int d\vec{\tau}\,\mathcal{P}(\vec{\tau})E_L(\vec{\tau})$
		\item We can calculate it as $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}E_L(\vec{\tau})$ for a big enough $n$
		\item In other words, the idea is to sample tons of $E_L$ values at different positions in space and then take the mean
		\item Since the $E_L$'s have a certain distribution, we should sample more points where the probability is higher and less points where the probability is lower, in order to be sure to have a consistent set of samples.
		\item \alert{But how can we achieve such a distribution of samples?}
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Metropolis algorithm}

	\uncover<+->{The solution is to use the \alert{Metropolis algorithm}.}
	
	\uncover<+->{Let's suppose that we have just sampled $E_L$ at a certain point in space, let's call it $\vec{r}^{\text{old}}$.} \uncover<+->{Then, we make a \alert{random move} to another point in space, $\vec{r}^{\text{new}}$.}
	
	\uncover<+->{To check whether we moved to a higher probability region, we calculate the ratio of the respective probabilities, that is }
	
	\uncover<+->{
		\begin{equation}
			R 
			\doteqdot \frac{\mathcal{P}(\vec{r}^{\text{new}})}{\mathcal{P}(\vec{r}^{\text{old}})}
			= \frac{|\psi(\vec{r}^{\text{new}})|^2}{|\psi(\vec{r}^{\text{old}})|^2}.
		\end{equation}
	}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Metropolis algorithm}
	
	\uncover<+->{Then}
	
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item If $R \geq 1$, we accept this move because we are moving to a higher probability region and we sample $E_L$ in the new position.
		\item If $R < 1$, we can't blindly reject this move just because we are moving to a lower probability region; after all, we also have to populate the tails of the distribution! However, we can't accept all of this kind of moves.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\uncover<+->{\emph{Solution}: generate a random number $r \in (0,1)$, and accept the move (i.e., sample $E_L$) if $r \leq R$. Otherwise, the sample is rejected.}
	
	\uncover<+->{This procedure is known as the \alert{brute force} Metropolis algorithm.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Metropolis algorithm}
	
	\uncover<+->{Let's recap it:}
	
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Choose a starting position $\vec{r}^{\text{old}}$ and a step-length $l$.
		\item Generate a random number $\varepsilon$ in the interval $(0,1)$ and compute a new position $\vec{r}^{\text{new}} = \vec{r}^{\text{old}} + l\varepsilon$.
		\item Compute the acceptance ratio $R = \frac{|\psi_T(\vec{r}^{\text{new}})|^2}{|\psi_T(\vec{r}^{\text{old}})|^2}$.
		\item Generate a new random number $r$ in the interval $(0,1)$.
		\item If $R \geq r$, accept the step and store the position by letting $\vec{r}^{\text{old}} = \vec{r}^{\text{new}}$.
		\item If $R < r$, reject the step and  discard the position by letting $\vec{r}^{\text{new}} = \vec{r}^{\text{old}}$.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Choose the proper step-length}

	\uncover<+->{\alert{Problem:}} \uncover<+->{we have \emph{no rule} to say what a proper step length should be.}
	
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item If it's \emph{too much}, our walker will make huge jumps all around and will sample very few points inside our distribution; the measurement will not be good.
		\item If it's \emph{too less}, our walker will wander around the starting point and will not cover all the distribution space; the measurement will not be good as well.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\uncover<+->{\alert{Solution:}} \uncover<+->{as a \emph{rule of thumb}, one can test different step lengths and then choose the one that gives an acceptance of around $\SI{50}{\percent}$.}
	
	\note{
		So far, we haven't specified any rule for the choice of the step length. \alert{READ LIST}.

\begin{frame}{Importance sampling}

	\uncover<+->{\emph{Idea:} use the knowledge about the system to improve the acceptance ratio $R$.}
	
	\note{An improved acceptance ratio wastes less points.}
	
	\uncover<+->{Procedure:}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Recast the Schr\"{o}dinger equation a \emph{diffusion problem}, in which the walker is pushed in those regions where the trial wave-function is larger.
		\item The force $\vec{F}$ responsible for pushing the walker is called the \emph{quantum force}, and can be expressed as
		\uncover<+->{
			\begin{equation}
				\vec{F}=2\frac{1}{\psi_T}\nabla\psi_T
			\end{equation}
		}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\note{
		A better approach is to implement the \emph{Importance sampling}, that consists in doing more clever assumptions on the shape of the transition probability.
		
		Since we know the system we are working on, we know that if we recast the Schr\"{o}dinger equation as a diffusion problem, the transition probability is going to be a Gaussian distribution (or a modified Gaussian).
		
		The driving force of this diffusion problem is called the \emph{quantum force}, and can be expressed as \alert{SHOW THE FORMULA}.

		\item We are performing a \emph{numerical inversion of a matrix} ($\sim\mathcal{O}(n^3)$).
		\item There is no optimization of the acceptance ratio.
		\item The determinant of a matrix has a computational complexity of $\sim\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, so we might not see improvements up to 12-20 particles.

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Summary}

	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item The VMC technique is an easy-to-implement tool that gives an upper bound to the ground state energy of a system.
		\item Although is used as a starting point for DMC calculations, if we choose our trial wave-function in a smart way this technique gives an upper bound that is surprisingly compatible with the actual ground-state energy.
		\item For $N$ interacting electrons in an attractive potential, a good approximation of the actual wave-function is
		\begin{equation*}
			\psi_T(\vec{r}_1,\ldots,\vec{r}_N) = |S^{\uparrow}||S^{\downarrow}|J
		\end{equation*}
		\item For a quantum dot, the calculations can be further simplified by analytical means.
		\item In general, such a simplification is not possible; what one does is to optimize the code and to parallelize it as much as possible via OpenMP/MPI and possibly GPU parallelization.
		\item \alert{Thanks for your attention!}
