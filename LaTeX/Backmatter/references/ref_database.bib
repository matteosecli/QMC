@article{Brack1972,
abstract = {This paper reviews various results related to the single-particle structure in spherical and deformed nuclei, discussed from the viewpoint of the so-called shell-correction method. This method stresses the importance of large-scale nonuniformities in the energy distribution of the individual particles especially near the Fermi energy. The way in which these nonuniformities affect in an essential way many nuclear properties, such as the shape stiffness, the spatial density distribution, the total mass of the nucleus, the mass and inertia of the nuclear shape variations, etc. is also discussed. Against this background, the behavior of the nuclear deformation energy is described, in particular for larger distortions relevant to the fission process. In this connection, some qualitative singularities of the phenomenological liquid-drop deformation energy at large shape distortions are pointed out, and their possible implications for fission are discussed. As the problems considered cover a wide range of nuclear properties, this paper is not a review in the narrow sense of the word. Comparison with other approaches as well as historic references are given mainly to clarify specific points, because a complete review would be a monumental undertaking.},

Experimental techniques for measuring the electronic shell structure and the effect of magnetic fields are briefly described. The electronic structure is analyzed in terms of simple single-particle models, density-functional theory, and “exact” diagonalization methods. The spontaneous magnetization due to Hund’s rule, spin-density wave states, and electron localization are addressed. As a function of the magnetic field, the electronic structure goes through several phases with qualitatively different properties. The formation of the so-called maximum-density droplet and its edge reconstruction is discussed, and the regime of strong magnetic fields in finite dot is examined. In addition, quasi-one-dimensional rings, deformed dots, and dot molecules are considered.},

@article{Austing1999,
abstract = {Addition energy spectra at 0 T of circular and ellipsoidally deformed few-electron vertical quantum dots are measured and compared to results of model calculations within spin-density functional theory. Because of the rotational symmetry of the lateral harmonic confining potential, circular dots show a pronounced shell structure. With the lifting of the single- particle level degeneracies, even a small deformation is found to radically alter the shell structure leading to significant modifications in the addition energy spectra. Breaking the circular symmetry with deformation also induces changes in the total spin. This "piezo-magnetic" behavior of quantum dots is discussed, and the addition energies for a set of realistic deformation parameters are provided. For the case of the four-electron ground state at 0 T, a spin-triplet to spin-singlet transition is predicted, i.e. Hund's first rule no longer applies. Application of a magnetic field parallel to the current confirms that this is the case, and also suggests that the anisotropy of an elliptical dot, in practice, may be higher than that suggested by the geometry of the device mesa in which the dot is located.},
